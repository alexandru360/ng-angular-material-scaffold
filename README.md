# NG - Angular material scaffolding

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.1.

_Project designated for starting a material design project from scratch that works without going to the troubble of scaffolding a new one._

**Happy cloning :)**
